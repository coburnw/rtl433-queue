# rtl433-queue
Python Queues with Threads for the RTL-433 Library

A Python class to wrap the RTL-433 Library in queues and threads.  Allows a python app to register and get parameters of 
interest in a vaguely mosquitto way without worrying about the details of threading and queues.

see \__main__ for an example of usage

todo:
 * serious cleanup, but it works for me.

This is a stripped down derivative of Ciar√°n Mooney's work, see https://github.com/ciaranmooney/rtl_433_2sqlite which is a
derivative of jcarduino's work, see https://github/jcarduino/rtl_433_2db

Thanks to both.
